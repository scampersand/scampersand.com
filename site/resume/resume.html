    <div class="resume-position">
      <h3>Python/Django Web Developer for ePrintCenter</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="resume-date">
      <h3>Hewlett-Packard, 2010-present</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">ePrintCenter is both a customer web site
    for configuring HP's web-connected printers, and the
    constellation of web services behind the scenes to support
    those printers. I joined the team as a developer and grew into
    the role of technical lead for all Python/Django projects
    involving ePrintCenter.</p>

    <ul class="resume-bullet">
      <li>Led development of a centralized HTTP/REST back-end
      service to streamline the printer application lifecycle. The
      service uses pervasive caching to handle a high volume of
      requests without sacrificing correctness, and it's entirely
      covered by unit tests.</li>

      <li>Designed and implemented ePrintCenter exception handling
      to connect back-end service failures to appropriate end user
      messaging using Python decorators and AJAX.</li>

      <li>Designed and implemented localized caching of the
      ePrintCenter home page using Akamai to reduce the load on the
      Apache application servers by half.</li>

      <li>Built a production replica cluster to stage the rollout
      of multiple ePrintCenter releases, including upgrading major
      components such as Django and South.</li>

      <li>Automated printer simulator registration to facilitate
      development of the ePrintCenter web site.</li>

      <li>Installed and administrated Red Hat Enterprise Linux
      cluster providing virtual machines for developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="resume-date">
      <h3>Hewlett-Packard, 2009-2010</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">The OSLP is a formally-recognized
    collaboration between engineers inside HP, working across
    organizational boundaries to enable Linux as a viable platform
    in a predominately Windows environment.</p>

    <ul class="resume-bullet">
      <li>Led development of an externally-facing HTTP proxy
      accessible using SSL tunnels with PKCS#11 smart card,
      certificate-based authentication. This remote access service
      is now running as a pilot within HP.</li>

      <li>Wrote “access-hp” remote access client to use the HTTP
      proxy for general remote access from Linux.</li>

      <li>Worked with HP-IT to form a long-term plan to deploy
      OpenVPN for HP's non-Windows teleworkers.</li>

      <h3>Linux Virtualization Engineer</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="resume-date">
      <h3>Hewlett-Packard, 2006-2010</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">HP makes high-end machines with large
    core counts and memory, ideal for virtualization.</p>

    <ul class="resume-bullet">
      <li>Led a successful cross-company effort (HP, Intel,
      Fujitsu, Red Hat) porting Xen/IA64 into RHEL 5, including
      Linux kernel patches and substantial changes to Red Hat's
      “grubby” tool for configuring the bootloader to use a
      hypervisor. This technology was delivered to customers as a
      “tech preview” in RHEL 5 and then fully supported in RHEL
      5.1.</li>

      <li>Delivered a reference architecture based on the DL785 (a
      48-core beast with 256 GB memory) running RHEL 5.4 with KVM.
      My NUMA-tuned configuration achieved sub-second response with
      256 simultaneous guests. The white paper was published by
      both Red Hat and HP to meet a tight market-driven
      schedule.</li>

      <li>Wrote “tiler” utility (Bash) and parallelized test
      harness (Ruby) for VM provisioning and load testing, in
      support of building the reference architecture.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="resume-position">

      <h3>Hewlett-Packard, 2004-2006</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">Selling Linux into government and high
    finance requires officially-recognized security certifications.
    I wrote the “audit-test” harness (Bash) and “augrok” tool
    (Perl) which were used for successful CAPP and LSPP
    certifications at the time, and are still being used today for
    ongoing certification efforts by HP.</p>

    <div class="resume-date">
      <h3>Compaq, 1999-2004</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">Tru64 was a high-performance UNIX
    running on the Alpha processor. I joined the network team to
    develop the Ethernet drivers used by NASA, 911 call centers,
    stock market exchanges and major telephone carriers.</p>

    <ul class="resume-bullet">
      <li>Wrote Tigon3 Gigabit Ethernet driver consisting of 13k
      lines of threaded C, including a custom high-performance
      interrupt mitigation algorithm.</li>

      <li>Designed and implemented 64-bit network counters with
      backward-compatible ioctls.</li>

      <li>Debugged critical network driver issues for Ericsson and
      Motorola telco releases.</li>

    <div class="resume-date">
      <h3>Burlington Coat Factory, 1997-1998</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">At Burlington Coat Factory, I developed
    a unified printing system based on LPRng with the ability to
    print to any printer in the company, including the stores, from
    anywhere on the network. I also played a key role in helping
    BCF migrate from SunOS to Linux in the stores by prototyping
    the store back-end server using Red Hat Linux on SPARC.</p>

    <div class="resume-section">
      <h2>Open Source</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">I have contributed to all the major
    Linux distributions and numerous upstream projects such as
    Mutt, Vim, GNOME, klibc and Django. Below are some of my
    favorites.</p>

    <div class="resume-position">
      <h3>Gentoo Linux</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="resume-date">
      <h3>2001-2007</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">Gentoo is a source-based Linux
    distribution, meaning that the system actually builds a
    customized version of itself on your machine rather than
    installing pre-built binary packages. I was one of the first
    developers to join the Gentoo team and played key roles in its
    development and leadership.</p>

    <ul class="resume-bullet">
      <li>Designed and wrote network startup code and initscript
      conf.d processing.</li>

      <li>Wrote and maintained the ebuilds for the largest packages
      such as baselayout, mozilla, firefox, ruby and vim.</li>

      <li>Wrote votify software used for all Gentoo internal
      elections. The software includes balloting, collection and
      ranking determination using the Condorcet method.</li>

      <li>Exceeded 13,500 CVS commits tracked by cia.vc</li>

      <li>Served in leadership roles as a Gentoo Council member and
      as one of the founding trustees of the Gentoo
      Foundation.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="resume-position">
      <h3>Keychain</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">Keychain is a command-line front-end to
    cryptographic agents such as ssh-agent and gpg-agent. It was
    originally conceived by somebody else, but I rewrote it to add
    features, port to non-Linux platforms, and add a comprehensive
    test suite. Keychain is now included in all the major Linux
    distributions.</p>

    <div class="resume-position">
      <h3>Userpass</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="resume-body">I wrote this command-line utility to
    solve the problem of securely storing username/password pairs.
    Userpass is written in Ruby, and uses a novel per-host database
    scheme to avoid merge conflicts on GnuPG-encrypted files.</p>
