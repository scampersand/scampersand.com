    <h2>How we do it</h2>

    <p>
        Over that time we've developed some
        shared philosophies that guide our collaboration:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                We invest in the up-front planning so that we can execute
                smoothly with a common understanding of the next steps and end
                product. Planning and execution are separate modes--if
                something comes up that calls for a change, we halt execution
                and toggle as a team to reassess the plan. We firmly believe
                that a disciplined process is the best way to avoid waste and
                frustration, and yields a better result.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                We investigate alternatives even when the answer seems obvious.
                The human tendency is to adopt the first solution we think of.
                By forcing ourselves to consider alternatives, we often discover
                solutions that are better and cost less.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                We enjoy our work. Doesn't mean there's never any stress, but we
                try to keep perspective, sigh and grin, and embrace the journey.
            </p>
        </li>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p>
        Our first experience working together was as college students--we
        were already pair programming when the term was
        <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">first coined</a>.
        Aron was preparing to debug a messy chain of conditionals when Amy said,
        "Don't do that, you know how it should work and it'll take less time to
        rewrite it from scratch."
    </p>

    <p>
        The synergy we discovered in that moment became a constant, even as our
        careers alternately diverged and converged. We spent a while working on
        software together at HP, then Amy took a few years to pursue graphic
        design at RISD while Aron freelanced for a startup. We find ourselves
        intersecting again on web app design and implementation, and we're
        excited by the opportunity to partner as Scampersand.
    </p>

         We worked together on software at HP, then
         Amy took a few years to
        pursue graphic design at RISD while Aron freelanced for a startup.

        We both come from a software background
        The theme of our careers has been collaboration, with the common
        refrain: "What are you working on? How can I help?"
        We started Scampersand because we find that our shared philosophy
        and enjoyment of our work--along with skill sets that complement each
        other--enable us to work as an extraordinarily productive team with
        exceptional results.

            We launched Scampersand because
            we enjoy working together,
            and collaborating produces a better result.

        2000/3000 sizes are for testing what browsers actually fetch.
        When we have a real image, just use 500/1000 sizes like Aron's above.
