    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        "What are you working on? How can I help?"
        This has been a common refrain through the course of our careers.
        We launched Scampersand because we work well together
        and have fun doing it.

        A paragraph about who makes up Scampersand, why we started it, and
        whatâ€™s important to us.

        significant combined skill set to bear on client projects.

        take this partnership to the next level by
        focusing our combined technical, design, organizational and
        communication skills on client projects.

        Scampersand is the creative partnership of Aron &amp; Amy Griffis.

        We started this company

        We've worked in proximity, sometimes on the same teams, for most of our professional lives.

        * enjoyment of working together
        * increased productivity from working together
        * combined technical/design/organizational skillset
        * shared philosophies:
            * disciplined process yields a better result
            * always investigate alternatives

        From beautiful interfaces built with HTML5 and React to complex SSO/API
        integrations with Django, we excel at producing usable, scalable
        solutions to technically challenging problems.
