    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
        "What are you working on? How can I help?"
        The common refrain through our careers has been collaboration. We
        started Scampersand because complementary skills with a shared
        philosophy and enjoyment of our work are an amazing combination that
        produces extraordinary results.

        We have a few guiding principles as we approach a project:

        Along the way, we've learned a few things: planning and execution are
        separate activities,

        We launched Scampersand because
        we enjoy working together,
        and collaborating produces a better result.

    <h2>What We Do</h2>

    <p>
        We have a few guiding principles as we approach a project:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                We invest in the up-front planning so that we can execute
                smoothly with a common understanding of the next steps and end
                product. Planning and execution are separate modes--if
                something comes up that calls for a change, we halt execution
                and toggle as a team to reassess the plan. We firmly believe
                that a disciplined process is the best way to avoid waste and
                frustration, and yields a better result.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                We investigate alternatives even when the answer seems obvious.
                As humans, our tendency is to adopt the first solution we think
                of. By forcing ourselves to consider alternatives, we often
                discover find solutions that are better and cost less!
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                We have a third guiding principle, I'm just sure of it.
                Probably something to do with proactive communication and
                engagement with clients.
            </p>

    </ol>

        2000/3000 sizes are for testing what browsers actually fetch.
        When we have a real image, just use 500/1000 sizes like Aron's above.
