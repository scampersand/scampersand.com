                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a young couple fresh out of college, we were anxious
                        to start on the right foot financially. We wanted to
                        track our spending, but it was annoying to keep receipts
                        and then remember to enter them into the computer at
                        home. We wanted a solution that would move the data
                        entry closer to the time of purchase. Besides, hooking
                        up Perl and PostgreSQL just sounded fun.

                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since <a href="http://mint.com">mint.com</a>
                            wouldn't exist for another decade, we built a
                            web-based expense tracker so we could enter
                            expenditures from our desk computers at work. The
                            interface was simple but functional: one screen for
                            entering and categorizing purchases, and another for
                            generating reports. We have fond memories of our
                            first collaboration on a web project, even if we're
                            quite happy that automated budgeting replaced it
                            eventually.
