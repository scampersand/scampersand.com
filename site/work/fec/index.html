                    <p>
                        As part of the FEC site overhaul, the 18F team needed
                        new <a href="https://wagtail.io/">Wagtail</a> templates
                        for publishing reports, weekly digests and news
                        releases. The templates required specific presentation
                        for typography, images and authorship. Additionally
                        there would need to be custom Python code and database
                        tables for associating authors with articles.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <div class="grid-row">
                <div class="grid-full">
                    <div class="grid-main">
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            The schedule for the project was extremely
                            short--less than a week--so our first step was to
                            comprehensively investigate every unknown and
                            convert it from a risk to a plan. We alternated
                            between pairing and working individually to maximize
                            productivity while ensuring there wouldn't be any
                            miscommunication on the team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It quickly became apparent that the biggest
                            challenge would be coming up with a way to manage
                            the many-to-many relationship between articles and
                            authors, something that Django supports but Wagtail
                            doesn't. We were able to identify a solution that
                            enabled Django's support for inline relationships to
                            work seamlessly in the Wagtail admin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Scampersand we like the phrase "yards after the
                            catch," referring to the extra distance the receiver
                            runs after catching the football. On this project,
                            our YATC was to enable coverage measurement of the
                            Python tests, to ensure that our new code was being
                            tested properly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few days later, we filed the pull request: on
                            time, following project markup and style
                            conventions, with tests and documentation.
                            The 18F team was delighted.
