        As a young couple fresh out of college, we were anxious to start on the
        right foot financially. We wanted to track our spending, but it was
        annoying to keep receipts and need to enter them into the computer at
        home. <a herf="http://mint.com">Mint.com</a> wouldn’t exist for another
        decade, so we built a web-based expense tracker so we could enter our
        own expenditures from our desk computers at work. It was our first
        collaboration on a web project—Perl CGI with a PostgreSQL database—and
        we’re still quite proud of it.
