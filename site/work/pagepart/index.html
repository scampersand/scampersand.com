                        PagePart provides mobile-friendly sites for small
                        businesses. The sites are easy to customize with
                        pluggable parts.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        For many small businesses, the shift to mobile happened
                        shortly after they'd invested in a website designed for
                        a desktop. The business owner was caught between two bad
                        options: on the one hand, sinking money into a new site;
                        on the other hand, alienating customers trying to view
                        the site on their phones. PagePart sought to provide a
                        third option whereby the small business could have a
                        mobile-friendly site without disrupting their existing
                        site investment.

            <div class="grid-row">
                <div class="grid-full">
                    <div class="grid-main">
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            PagePart contracted Aron to build a custom content
                            management system for creating mobile sites. The
                            system provided one-click importing of structured
                            data from Facebook to generate an initial site. The
                            business owner could then customize their site using
                            a catalog of pluggable "parts" including Google
                            Maps, Google Calendar, Twitter, OpenTable, Yelp, RSS
                            feed, and others. A JavaScript snippet redirected
                            mobile browsers from the original desktop site to
                            the new mobile-friendly rendering. Alternatively the
                            business owner could switch entirely to their
                            PagePart site for desktop as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As people started using the system, something
                            unexpected happened: small web agencies started
                            using PagePart to provide a mobile site to their
                            clients. To meet the needs of this market, Aron
                            added a partner dashboard for managing multiple
                            sites, along with the ability to white label the
                            editor, so that an agency could provide branded
                            access to its clients on a custom domain.
