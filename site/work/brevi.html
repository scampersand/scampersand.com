    <strong>Brevi</strong> helps small businesses advertise on Facebook
    easily by harnessing existing partner data to generate ads. As
    technical co-founder, Aron developed the system including six partner
    OAuth and API integrations, payment through Stripe, and a custom
    Facebook Graph client for making batch requests at scale. Amy
    contracted to the startup to provide UX and visual design for the Brevi
    product, as well as development of the e-commerce ad generation code.
