                    <p>
                        Big companies are advertising on Facebook but small
                        businesses aren't. It's not hard to understand why. For
                        someone who isn't a marketing expert, it's not obvious
                        how to put together an ad that will capture the interest
                        of viewers. Then there's the Facebook ads manager, a
                        complex set of controls for budgeting, scheduling and
                        targeting that can thwart even the most determined user.
                        For the small business owner trying to squeeze marketing
                        into the end of a long day, it's an overwhelming task
                        that gets postponed indefinitely.

                        Brevi's vision was to level the playing field by
                        providing an easy wizard for ad creation. Brevi would
                        charge a flat rate and simplify the controls to guide
                        the business owner from "Get Started" to "Launch My Ad"
                        in minutes.

                        Brevi's vision was to level the playing field by making
                        it easy to create an ad. The software would tap
                        third-party data to suggest ad content tailored to the
                        business. Brevi would charge a flat rate and simplify
                        the controls so the business owner could launch their ad
                        as quickly as possible.

                            We built a wizard to guide the user through the
                            process of creating an ad. The wizard draws on
                            business information such as the catalog for an
                            e-commerce store or the scheduling system for a gym.
                            Armed with this data, the wizard asks easy-to-answer
                            questions to generate an ad promoting the business.
                            After customizing the ad and paying with a credit
                            card, the user receives email updates and can return
                            to the site to track the progress of their campaign.

                            As technical co-founder, Aron developed the system
                            including six partner OAuth and API integrations.
                            Each integration offers access to a pool of users
                            and the opportunity to test the market for ads in a
                            given vertical. Aron also wrote a custom Facebook
                            Graph client for batching requests, enabling back
                            office reporting at scale.

                            Amy contracted to the startup to provide UX and
                            visual design. Her contributions included
                            streamlining the wizard by grouping related
                            information, sequencing the forms as a narrative,
                            and surveying users to â€¦ Amy additionally wrote the
                            code to generate the ad based on the wizard results.
