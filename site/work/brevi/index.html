                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Big companies are advertising on Facebook but small
                        businesses aren't. It's not hard to understand why. For
                        someone who isn't a marketing expert, it's not obvious
                        how to put together an ad that will capture the interest
                        of viewers. Additionally the Facebook ads manager
                        has complex controls for budgeting, scheduling and
                        targeting that can thwart even the most determined
                        user. For the small business owner trying to
                        squeeze marketing into the end of a long day, it's
                        an overwhelming chore that gets postponed
                        indefinitely.

                            Brevi's vision is to level the playing field by
                            making it easy to launch an ad. The application
                            guides the user through the process of creating
                            an ad by asking easy-to-answer questions about
                            ad content, and offering simplified choices for
                            budgeting and scheduling. Brevi also taps
                            third-party data to suggest ad content that's
                            tailored to the business, and configures
                            highly-specfic Facebook audience targeting.

                        <p>
                            Our primary focus was to streamline the ad
                            creation process, by asking only what was
                            necessary, and providing limited but meaningful
                            choices about ad content.

                            As technical co-founder, Aron developed the
                            system including six partner OAuth and API
                            integrations, as well as a custom Facebook
                            Graph client that enables back office reporting
                            at scale. Amy contracted to the startup to
                            provide UI and UX design, and Python
                            development.
