        Running a Secret Santa gift exchange among family
        members can be tough! Drawing names from a hat is a good start, but how
        do you avoid someone picking their own name? Or the name of their
        spouse? Or the name of the person giving to them? Or the name of the
        person they gave to last year and the year before?
    </p>

        Simply Wish was a fun project of Amyâ€™s between
        employment at HP and studying graphic design at RISD. It uses
        constraint programming to draw names from a virtual hat, tracks wish
        lists for the participants, and we continue to depend on it for our
        family gift swaps each Christmas.
