                        HP's web-enabled printers receive print jobs over the
                        Internet and run apps similar to a phone or tablet.
                        These features are configured by customers at the
                        ePrintCenter website.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Scampersand founders Aron &amp; Amy--employed by HP at the
                        time--joined the ePrintCenter team shortly after the
                        initial release. Schedule pressure had forced
                        compromises such as copying data manually between
                        servers, and this was coming back to bite in the form of
                        customer-visible bugs. Integration testing was
                        non-existent because teams hadn't built staging servers
                        for other teams to develop against. Site deployments
                        were synchronized with printer hardware releases, taking
                        a toll on the developers in the form of late-night
                        "deployment parties." Meanwhile the servers struggled as
                        traffic surged.

                        It was an exciting time to jump in.

                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            We contributed to numerous feature releases during
                            our year and a half on the team. Here are some of
                            the highlights:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-bulleted">
                            <li>
                                Coordinating with a team in India, we built the
                                prototype of an app provisioning service to act
                                as a central authority governing which apps were
                                available to be installed on a given printer.
                                This would eventually replace manually copied
                                data with an API designed to meet the needs of
                                the various stakeholders. Among those was
                                ePrintCenter itself, which we ported to use
                                the new service.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We built a cluster of virtual machines so that
                                remote teams could run integration tests against
                                ePrintCenter snapshots with production
                                parity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To decouple site updates from printer hardware
                                releases, we added run-time configuration flags
                                with date triggers so that deployments could
                                proceed on their own schedule.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We added localized page delivery for the
                                ePrintCenter site using Akamai, to handle the
                                increased customer traffic taking country and
                                language into account.
                            </li>
