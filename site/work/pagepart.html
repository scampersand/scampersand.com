    <strong>PagePart</strong> was a startup helping small businesses make
    mobile-friendly websites. The startup contracted Aron to build the
    system, which would import structured data from Facebook to generate an
    initial site then allow complete customization. There were two distinct
    challenges: first, to support a number of pre-made “parts” that could
    be plugged into a site, including Google Maps, Google Calendar,
    Twitter, OpenTable, Yelp, RSS feed, and others; second, to provide the
    site editor as a white-label product so agencies could offer it to
    their clients under their own brand. These goals were achieved and
    PagePart gained a number of fiercely loyal users during its run.
