        <strong>PagePart</strong> was a startup helping small businesses make
        mobile-friendly websites. The startup contracted Aron to build the
        system, which would import structured data from Facebook to generate an
        initial site then allow complete customization.

        The first requirement was to support
        pre-made "parts" that could be plugged into a site, including Google
        Maps, Google Calendar, Twitter, OpenTable, Yelp, RSS feed, and others.
        The second requirement was to provide the site editor as a white-label
        product so agencies could offer it to their clients under their own
        brand. These goals were achieved and PagePart gained a number of
        fiercely loyal users during its run.
