        <strong>HP’s ePrintCenter</strong>--the site and services to support
        HP’s web-enabled printers—started small and needed to grow quickly.
        While employed by HP, Aron and Amy joined the team to help confront the
        challenges of scaling the project in multiple dimensions: customer
        traffic was escalating, development was fragmented between remote
        teams, deployments were infrequent and nerve-wracking, and data was
        duplicated between servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aron built a cluster of virtual machines
        with production parity so that remote teams could test integration with
        ePrintCenter snapshots. Amy decoupled printer releases from site
        updates using run-time configuration flags so that deployments could be
        more frequent. Coordinating with the team in India, Aron built an app
        provisioning service to de-duplicate data stores that were previously
        kept in sync manually, while Amy ported the ePrintCenter application to
        use the new service. Aron also added localized page delivery for the
        ePrintCenter site using a CDN, to handle the increased customer
        traffic.
