    <strong>HP’s ePrintCenter</strong>—the site and services to support 
    HP’s web-enabled printers—started small and needed to grow quickly.
    While employed by HP, Aron and Amy joined the team to help confront the
    challenges of scaling the project in multiple dimensions: customer
    traffic was escalating, development was fragmented between remote
    teams, deployments were infrequent and nerve-wracking, and data was
    duplicated between servers. Aron built a cluster of virtual machines
    with production parity so that remote teams could test integration with
    ePrintCenter snapshots. Amy decoupled printer releases from site
    updates using run-time configuration flags so that deployments could be
    more frequent. Coordinating with the team in India, Aron built an app
    provisioning service to de-duplicate data stores that were previously
    kept in sync manually, while Amy ported the ePrintCenter application to
    use the new service. Aron also added localized page delivery for the
    ePrintCenter site using a CDN, to handle the increased customer
    traffic.
